# simple docker container backup using [backup gem](https://github.com/backup/backup)

The purpose of this repo is to facilitate backups for docker containers.  
It is possible to backup files and databases linked via docker --link .  
```fabric``` is used to manage the deployment of the container. Whereas it is
a neat way using ```fabric```, it is not mandatory to use it.

## Setup Backup

1. setup the backup in models/default.rb following the [docs](http://meskyanichi.github.io/backup/v4/getting-started/)
2. Deploy repo: Copy it to your server or pull it from your code repository  
3. cd into repo and build the image: ```docker build -t simpleloop-backup .```
4. Setup your environment variables file as mentioned below
5. now run the container to execute your backup:

```docker run --rm -v <path-to-backup>:/data/ --name <container-name> --link <db-container-name>:<map-db-host-name> --env-file=<the-env-variables-file> <image-name>```
```docker run --rm -v /srv/simpleloop.com/media/:/data/ --name simpleloop-backup --link postgres_simpleloop:postgres --env-file=/srv/simpleloop.com/.bashrc simpleloop-backup```


Environment File

    BACKUP_NAME=thenameforthebackup   # The name of the backup
    BACKUP_SLACK_USERNAME=backupuser    # The username to display along with the notification
    BACKUP_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/yourwebhookurl   # the webhook_url
    BACKUP_SLACK_CHANNEL=theslackchannel   # the channel to which the message will be sent
    BACKUP_SLACK_ICON_EMOJI=:ghost:   # icon emoji is used to post the message to slack


## Schedule Backup

Create a job on your host system to run regularly. This can be the scheduler app of your choice. For example cron, [whenever gem](https://github.com/javan/whenever), anacron or similar.

This job should execute the command to run the backup container on regular intervals. Example:
A cronjob running everyday at 1:15 am:

```
15 1 * * * docker run --rm -v <path-to-backup>:/data/ --name <container-name> --link <db-container-name>:<map-db-host-name> --env-file=<the-env-variables-file>
```


## CREDITS

Credits to https://github.com/siuying/docker-backup as this repo is greatly inspired by docker-backup and
adapted to suit our needs. Especially we got rid of crontab and are focusing to build up a container that
can be used in multi-container environemnts.
