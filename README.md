# simple docker container backup using [backup gem](https://github.com/backup/backup)

The purpose of this repo is to facilitate backups for docker containers.  
It is possible to backup files and databases linked via docker --link .  
```fabric``` is used to manage the deployment of the container. Whereas it is
a neat way using ```fabric```, it is not mandatory to use it.

## Setup Backup

1. setup the backup in models/default.rb following the [docs](http://meskyanichi.github.io/backup/v4/getting-started/)
2. Deploy repo: Copy it to your server or pull it from your code repository  
3. cd into repo and build the image: ```docker build -t simpleloop-backup .```
4. Setup your environment variables file as mentioned below
5. run the container:

```docker run --rm -v <path-to-backup>:/data/ --name <container-name> --link <db-container-name>:<map-db-host-name> --env-file=<the-env-variables-file> <image-name>```
```docker run --rm -v /srv/simpleloop.com/media/:/data/ --name simpleloop-backup --link postgres_simpleloop:postgres --env-file=/srv/simpleloop.com/.bashrc simpleloop-backup```
