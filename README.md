# simple docker container backup using backup gem https://github.com/backup/backup

The purpose of this repo is to facilitate backups for docker containers.
It is possible to backup files and databases linked via docker --link .
```fabric``` is used to manage the deployment of the container. Whereas it is
a neat way using ```fabric```, it is not mandatory to use it.

ENV_FILE # file for environment variables. will be provided to the container
IMAGE_NAME # the name of the docker image to be created
CONTAINER_NAME = # the name of the docker container to be created

```pip install Fabric```

1. modify the fabfile to suit your requirements
